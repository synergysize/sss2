# Hover Functionality Debugging and Fixes - v27

## Issue Summary

The wallet hover interactions implemented in v26 were not functioning properly on the live site. The hover detection was working (raycasting was detecting intersections with wallet points), but the visual feedback and tooltip display were not visible to users.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing HTML Element**: The `wallet-tooltip` HTML element was not being properly loaded in the DOM, causing `null` references.
2. **Sprite Threshold Too Low**: The raycaster's sprite threshold was too small to reliably detect the wallet points.
3. **Visual Feedback Too Subtle**: The hover scaling and color changes were too subtle to be easily noticed by users.
4. **HTML Tooltip Limitations**: Using an HTML element for the tooltip had cross-browser compatibility issues.

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Dynamic DOM Element Creation**: Added code to dynamically create the tooltip element if it's not found in the DOM.
2. **Increased Raycaster Threshold**: Increased the raycaster's sprite threshold from 1 to 50, making it much easier to detect wallet points.
3. **Enhanced Visual Feedback**:
   - Increased the scaling factor for hovered wallet points from 1.5x to 5-8x original size
   - Added pulsing animation with yellow-white highlight for maximum visibility
   - Implemented sin wave animation for both scale and color to create a "breathing" effect

4. **3D Tooltip Implementation**: 
   - Created a new 3D tooltip system using Three.js sprites that renders directly in the 3D scene
   - This ensures consistent cross-browser compatibility
   - Tooltip follows the hovered wallet point in 3D space
   - Shows wallet address, token holdings, and total value

5. **Extensive Logging**: Added comprehensive debug logging to track:
   - Mouse position and raycaster status
   - Intersection detection success/failure
   - Wallet data retrieval
   - Tooltip rendering

## Performance Considerations

The implemented solutions maintain good performance even with:
- 1000+ wallet points for each token type
- 200 points per Level 2 cluster
- Dynamic animation effects

## Testing Methodology

1. Console logging to verify intersection detection
2. Visual inspection of hover effects
3. Tooltip display and content verification
4. Cross-browser testing

## Results

The hover functionality now works properly, with:
- Easily detectable wallet points
- Highly visible hover feedback (pulsing yellow-white glow)
- Clear display of wallet metadata
- Smooth animation without performance issues
