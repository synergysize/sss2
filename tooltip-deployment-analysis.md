# Tooltip Deployment Discrepancy Analysis

## Summary of Investigation

The tooltip changes were successfully committed and pushed to the `performance-optimizations` branch but are not appearing on the live site. This report explains why and provides recommended actions.

## Root Cause: Branch Discrepancy

**Primary Issue:** The Vercel deployment is linked to the `main` branch, but our tooltip changes are only in the `performance-optimizations` branch.

### Evidence:
1. The most recent commit on `main` branch (9aeab5e) does not include the tooltip changes
2. The tooltip changes exist in commit 2fbaf26 on the `performance-optimizations` branch
3. The directTooltipFix.js file on the performance-optimizations branch contains our changes:
   - Removed "Wallet Details" header
   - Removed "Holds Only" line
   - Converted wallet addresses to clickable Solscan URLs
4. The fix-summary.md file mentions that deployment happens via "GitHub â†’ Vercel flow"
5. The live site at https://sss2-six.vercel.app/ is running code from the `main` branch

## Deployment Process Analysis

Based on the repository structure and documentation:

1. Vercel is configured to deploy from the `main` branch automatically
2. Changes pushed to other branches (like `performance-optimizations`) don't trigger deployments
3. The tooltip changes are complete and working in the `performance-optimizations` branch
4. No merge to `main` has occurred since the tooltip changes were committed

## Recommended Actions

To apply the tooltip changes to the live site:

1. **Merge the changes from `performance-optimizations` into `main`**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge performance-optimizations
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Verify the deployment**:
   - Wait for Vercel to detect the push to `main` and trigger a deployment
   - Check the live site to confirm the tooltip changes are visible

3. **Alternative approach (if needed)**:
   - Create a manual deployment in Vercel pointing to the `performance-optimizations` branch
   - Update the Vercel configuration to deploy from the `performance-optimizations` branch

## Caching Considerations

If the changes are merged to `main` but still not appearing:

1. **CDN Cache**: Vercel might have CDN caching enabled. Try:
   - Append a query parameter to force refresh: `https://sss2-six.vercel.app/?refresh=true`
   - Request a cache invalidation in the Vercel dashboard

2. **Browser Cache**: Users' browsers might be caching old JavaScript files. Solutions:
   - Use cache-busting in production builds (already handled by Parcel with content hashing)
   - Add instructions for users to hard-refresh (Ctrl+F5)

## Conclusion

The tooltip changes are not appearing on the live site because they are in the `performance-optimizations` branch while Vercel is deploying from the `main` branch. A merge to `main` followed by a push will resolve this discrepancy and make the tooltip changes visible on the live site.
