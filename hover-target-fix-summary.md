# Hover Target and Distance Detection Fix (v29)

## Issues Fixed

1. **Wrong Hover Targets**
   - Previously: Tooltip appeared when hovering over large parent nodes
   - Fixed: Now tooltip only appears when hovering over small wallet points in the spherical shells

2. **No Distance Restriction**
   - Previously: Tooltip would show even when camera was zoomed out far away
   - Fixed: Added distance check to only show tooltip when camera is within a reasonable distance (10,000 units)

3. **Unnecessary Total Value Display**
   - Previously: Tooltip showed "Total Value" line that was redundant
   - Fixed: Removed the "Total Value" line from tooltips

## Implementation Details

### 1. Filtering Hover Targets

- Added filter to exclude Level 1 wallet nodes from raycaster targets:
  ```javascript
  let filteredWalletPoints = allWalletPoints.filter(point => {
    return !point.userData?.isLevel1Wallet;
  });
  ```
- Explicitly marked central parent nodes with `isLevel1Wallet: true`
- Explicitly marked child wallet points with `isLevel1Wallet: false`

### 2. Distance-Based Interaction

- Added distance check to disable hover interaction when zoomed out:
  ```javascript
  const cameraDistanceToCenter = camera.position.length();
  const maxInteractionDistance = 10000;
  
  let intersects = [];
  if (cameraDistanceToCenter <= maxInteractionDistance) {
    intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(filteredWalletPoints, false);
  }
  ```
- This ensures tooltips only appear when the user is close enough to meaningfully interact with wallet points

### 3. Passing Wallet Data

- Made sure wallet data is properly passed from parent nodes to child nodes:
  ```javascript
  walletNode.userData = {
    // other properties...
    isLevel1Wallet: false,
    walletData: parentWalletData
  };
  ```
- This ensures child wallet points have the correct data to display in tooltips

### 4. Tooltip Content Cleanup

- Removed "Total Value" line from HTML tooltip
- Updated tooltip creation and content updating functions to maintain the cleaner format

## Testing

- Verified hover only works on small wallet points (child nodes)
- Confirmed tooltip only appears when camera is within 10,000 units of the scene center
- Verified tooltip displays wallet address and token amounts correctly
- Ensured tooltip no longer shows the "Total Value" line

## Result

The hover interaction is now more targeted and precise, making it easier for users to explore individual wallet points without being distracted by parent nodes or tooltips appearing when zoomed out too far.
