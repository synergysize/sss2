# Hover Debug Summary for Version 30

## Issues Fixed

The broken hover functionality in v29 has been addressed with the following emergency fixes:

1. **Distance Restriction Removed**: Hover detection now works regardless of camera distance
   - Previously limited to 10,000 units from center
   - Increased to 50,000 units and temporarily disabled distance check entirely
   - Added debugging to log when distance would have been a factor

2. **Include ALL Wallet Points**: 
   - Now including ALL wallet points in raycaster targets
   - Previously filtered out Level 1 wallet nodes, potentially causing hover issues
   - Added detailed debugging to show how many points of each type

3. **Increased Raycaster Threshold**:
   - Sprite threshold dramatically increased from 50 to 200
   - Added Points threshold of 20 as well
   - This makes hover detection extremely forgiving

4. **Enhanced Intersection Debugging**:
   - Added detailed logging of intersections
   - Shows first 3 intersections with complete details
   - Logs when no intersections are found
   - Reports on all raycaster parameters

## Testing Validation

The changes allow for:

- Hover detection at any camera distance
- Detection of both small wallet points and Level 1 wallets
- Much more forgiving hit detection
- Comprehensive debugging output to find any remaining issues

These emergency changes are designed to restore basic hover functionality. Further refinements can be made in subsequent versions once the core hover features are working again.
