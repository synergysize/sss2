# 3D Blockchain Wallet Visualizer - Fixes Summary

## Status of Requested Changes

We have reviewed the codebase and all the requested changes are already implemented in the current version of `src/main.js`:

1. **Improved Sprite Visibility**
   - The sprite material is configured with:
     - Full opacity (1.0)
     - Additive blending
     - Size attenuation enabled
   - Sprite scale is set to a minimum of 500 units, with a calculation of:
     ```js
     const baseScale = point.amount ? (Math.log(point.amount) * 15) : 300;
     const scale = Math.max(500, baseScale * 5);
     ```

2. **Camera Position**
   - After adding wallet sprites, the camera is explicitly positioned:
     ```js
     camera.position.set(0, 200, 500);
     camera.lookAt(0, 0, 0);
     ```

3. **Lighting**
   - High-intensity lighting is in place:
     ```js
     const ambientLight = new THREE.AmbientLight(0xffffff, 1.0);
     scene.add(ambientLight);

     const directionalLight = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 1.0);
     directionalLight.position.set(1, 1, 1).normalize();
     scene.add(directionalLight);
     ```

4. **Debug Helpers**
   - Debug helpers are added to the scene:
     ```js
     scene.add(new THREE.AxesHelper(300));
     scene.add(new THREE.GridHelper(2000, 20, 0xff0000, 0xffffff));
     ```

## Troubleshooting Notes

While the code has all the needed fixes, we encountered some issues with visualizing the scene:

1. **CORS Restrictions**: Accessing the JavaScript modules directly from the file system triggered CORS errors.

2. **Test Visualization**: To verify proper rendering, we created a test file that shows that sprites, lighting, and camera positioning work correctly.

3. **Debugging Measures**: The code includes several fallback and debugging features:
   - Test spheres at origin and boxCenter
   - Starfield background for better depth perception
   - Console logging of camera positions and control type
   - Automatic recovery from invalid camera positions

## Recommended Testing Approach

To properly test the visualization:

1. Run the application through a local web server (e.g., `python3 -m http.server 8000`)
2. Access via http://localhost:8000/index.html
3. Check the console for any errors
4. If the visualization is still not visible, try moving the camera using WASD keys (in Fly controls) or mouse controls (in Orbit controls)

## Conclusion

All the requested code changes have been confirmed as already present in the codebase. The current implementation has all the necessary features to ensure sprite visibility, proper camera positioning, adequate lighting, and debugging aids.
