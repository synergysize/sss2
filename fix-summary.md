# 3D Blockchain Visualizer (SSS) - Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The 3D Blockchain Visualizer was experiencing a black screen issue on desktop browsers while working correctly on mobile devices. After analyzing the code, I identified that the problem was related to the implementation of `FlyControls` for desktop environments.

## Changes Made
1. Replaced `FlyControls` with `OrbitControls` for desktop environments
   - This ensures consistent rendering behavior across all platforms
   - `OrbitControls` has proven more stable and reliable in Three.js applications

2. Updated control instructions to match the new control scheme
   - Simplified to use the same instructions for all device types
   - Removed device-specific keyboard instructions

3. Fixed window resize handler
   - Removed page reload on device type changes
   - Simplified resize behavior

4. Optimized animation loop
   - Improved control update logic
   - Simplified camera position validation

## Implementation Status
- All changes have been successfully committed and pushed to the GitHub repository
- The changes should be automatically deployed via the GitHub â†’ Vercel flow
- Once the changes are deployed, desktop users should see the visualization working correctly

## Next Steps
1. Verify the deployment on Vercel (https://sss-rho-ten.vercel.app)
2. If the issue persists, check Vercel deployment logs
3. Consider additional optimizations:
   - Improved lighting and visibility
   - Refined camera positioning
   - Performance optimizations for large datasets

## Technical Details
The primary issue was identified in the controls initialization logic, where `FlyControls` was causing rendering issues on desktop browsers. By standardizing on `OrbitControls` for all environments, we ensure consistent behavior while maintaining intuitive navigation.
