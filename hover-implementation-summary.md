# Wallet Hover Interactions and Metadata Display - v26

## Summary of Changes

I've successfully implemented hover effects, color coding, and metadata display for individual wallet points in the 3D Blockchain Visualizer, creating a more interactive and informative experience. The implementation is now available in version 26 of the application.

## Color Coding Implementation

Wallets are now color-coded according to the requirements:

- **White**: Wallets holding both Fartcoin and Goat tokens (shared wallets)
- **Green**: Wallets holding only Fartcoin tokens
- **Blue**: Wallets holding only Goat tokens
- **Brightness**: All wallet colors vary in brightness based on token amount (higher amount = brighter)

## Hover Functionality

When hovering over wallet points, users now experience:

1. **Visual Feedback**: Points become larger and brighter when hovered
2. **Metadata Display**: A tooltip appears showing wallet details
3. **Smooth Transitions**: Hover effects fade in/out with a smooth animation

## Tooltip Information

The tooltip shows the following wallet metadata:

- Wallet address (shortened format: first 8 + last 4 characters)
- Token holdings (Fartcoin amount, Goat amount, or both)
- Total value held

## Technical Implementation

- Used Three.js Raycaster for precise hover detection
- Created CSS-based tooltip that follows the mouse cursor
- Implemented color coding in the positionMapper.js file
- Added wallet metadata to userData for easy access
- Ensured performance remains smooth with thousands of wallet points

## User Interface Updates

- Added hint in controls panel about hover functionality
- Created styled tooltip with clear visual hierarchy
- Maintained consistent UI styling with the rest of the application

The hover system and color coding are now fully implemented and deployed as version 26 on the live site.
