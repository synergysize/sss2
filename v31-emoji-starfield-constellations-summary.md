# Version 31: Emoji, Enhanced Starfield, and Constellations

This update adds exciting visual enhancements to the 3D Blockchain Wallet Visualizer:

## 1. Text Replaced with Emojis

- Replaced "Fartcoin" with üí® emoji throughout the application
- Replaced "Goat Token" and "Goatcoin" with üêê emoji throughout the application
- Updated all tooltips, console logs, and UI elements

## 2. Enhanced Starfield Backdrop

- Created a much denser starfield with 8,000 background stars (4x more than before)
- Added a colorful Milky Way-like galaxy band across the sky with 5,000 dust particles
- Implemented beautiful gradient colors (blues, purples, whites) for stars and nebula
- Varied star brightness, sizes, and colors for a more realistic space backdrop
- Ensured 360¬∞ coverage for a fully immersive space environment

## 3. Added Constellations

### Goat Constellation
- Created a connect-the-dots goat shape with bright stars
- Positioned in the upper left area of the sky
- Added connecting lines between stars for easy identification
- Implemented a subtle blue glow effect around the constellation

### Butt Constellation
- Created a connect-the-dots butt/buttocks shape with bright stars
- Positioned in the upper right area of the sky
- Added connecting lines between stars for easy identification
- Implemented a subtle orange/peach glow effect around the constellation

### Pulsing Animation
- Both constellations randomly pulse brighter on a timer
- Stars grow larger and brighter during the pulse animation
- Connecting lines become more visible during pulsing
- Background glow intensifies during constellation activation
- Animation lasts 3 seconds with a smooth fade in/out

## Technical Implementation

- Used THREE.Points with custom BufferGeometry for the enhanced starfield
- Implemented THREE.Sprite objects with custom textures for constellation stars
- Created THREE.Line objects with custom materials for constellation connections
- Added subtle randomization to all elements for a more natural appearance
- Ensured constellations are visible from the default camera position
- Maintained performance despite the additional visual elements
