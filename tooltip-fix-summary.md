# Wallet Metadata Tooltip Fix - v28

## Issue Summary
The tooltip functionality was not working properly. When hovering over wallet points in the 3D visualization, the lighting effects were working (objects would highlight), but no tooltip with wallet metadata was being displayed to the user.

## Root Causes
1. The tooltip element existed in the DOM but wasn't being properly shown during hover events
2. There was confusion between the 3D tooltip and HTML tooltip implementations
3. The tooltip visibility styling was inadequate
4. Tooltip content wasn't being properly updated with wallet data

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created a Direct Tooltip Fix Module
- Created a new file `directTooltipFix.js` with simplified, robust tooltip functionality
- Implemented functions to ensure tooltip exists, show/hide tooltip, and update content
- Added high z-index and stronger visual styling to ensure visibility

### 2. Added Redundant Tooltip Systems
- Now displaying both the HTML tooltip and 3D tooltip simultaneously
- This provides backup if one system fails to render
- HTML tooltip follows the mouse cursor for better readability

### 3. Improved Tooltip Content
- Added "type of holder" information (Fartcoin only, Goatcoin only, or Both)
- Improved formatting of wallet addresses and token amounts
- Added stronger styling with better visibility (darker background, brighter text)

### 4. Added Multiple Initialization Points
- Tooltip is now initialized immediately on load
- Also added delayed initialization for reliability
- Added a DOM ready event listener as a final fallback

### 5. Improved Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error checking for wallet data
- Will create tooltip element if missing at any point
- Provides fallback values if wallet data is incomplete

## Testing & Verification
- Tested hover behavior on multiple wallet points
- Confirmed tooltip follows cursor with correct positioning
- Verified wallet address, token types and amounts display correctly
- Tested edge cases (rapid mouse movement, hovering boundaries)

## Version History
- v27: Previous version with hover lighting but no tooltip display
- v28: Current version with fixed wallet metadata tooltip display

This fix ensures users can now see detailed wallet information when exploring the 3D blockchain visualization.
