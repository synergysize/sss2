# Hover Debug Results for Version 30

## Changes Implemented
- Successfully deployed v30 with hover debugging enhancements
- Removed distance restrictions (increased from 10,000 to 50,000 and disabled check)
- Included ALL wallet points in raycaster detection
- Increased raycaster threshold for Sprites from 50 to 200 
- Added Points threshold of 20 as well
- Added comprehensive debugging output for intersection detection

## Results and Observations
- The application now shows v30 in the top-right corner
- Debug messages confirm hover is enabled and distance check is disabled
- Console shows "NO INTERSECTIONS FOUND with 43 wallet points" consistently
- Raycaster parameters are being logged correctly
- The visualization is displayed correctly and camera controls work

## Next Steps for v31
1. **Deeper Investigation of Raycaster**:
   - Verify that wallet points have correct `visible` property set to true
   - Check if sprites have the correct material properties
   - Examine if the points are in the correct layer for raycasting

2. **Alternative Detection Method**:
   - Consider implementing a fallback method using distance calculations
   - Create a helper function that finds closest points without relying on raycaster

3. **Scene Structure Review**:
   - Check if wallet points are direct children of the scene or nested too deeply
   - Verify the scene hierarchy to ensure raycaster can find the objects

4. **Debug Point Visibility**:
   - Add a visible debug sphere at each wallet point position
   - Use a different geometry type that might be easier for raycaster to detect

With v30, we've laid the groundwork for proper debugging and identified that the issue is specifically with the raycaster not finding intersections with wallet points.
